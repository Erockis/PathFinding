# PathFinding
Looking for help with adding in A* pathfinding, that is have enemie('s) chase the player around while also moving around obsticles. 

This isn't meant to be a game itself but more of how to do it.

I've add in pathfinding code I found on http://www.xdevmag.com/browse/1.5/1510/
http://www.xdevmag.com/browse/1.5/1510/1510.zip

However I haven't quite figured out to implement it correctly.

Currently the enemy just wonders around aimlessly.
